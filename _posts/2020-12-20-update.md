Above is a graph of CEA, a serum tumor marker. This is difficult for me to say,
but I am not in a good position right now. In the past, the marker rising above
80-90 has been very uncomfortable. As of two weeks ago, it was 74.

For the past 18 months, I have been riding my second round of traditional
chemotherapy[1]. This is what you think of when imagining cancer treatment.
Chemo broadly damages cellular DNA. The dividing cells are hit the hardest.
Luckily, my cancer turns out to be sensitive to this therapy, with the
expected collateral damage.

I have the typical side effects - fatigue, compromised immunity, hair loss,
nausea, and loss of appetite.

Traditional chemo doesn't get into the brain well, so the resistant disease in
my body has made it's way to my brain. In March, we discovered the cause of the
nausea and disturbed balance I had been having when a follow up brain MRI
revealed six small brain metastasis and an area read as leptomeningeal
metastasis. This news was devastating. 

Historically, leptomeningeal metastasis considered to be a dismal development
with survival measured in weeks, but with EGFR+ targeted therapy some patient's
are living for years, including notably former actress Valerie Harper. So far,
I've made it 9 months.

In top of this, like all of you, I've trying to survive the global COVID-19
pandemic with my family intact. As you might imagine having metastatic lung
cancer and being on chemotherapy put's one at somewhat increased risk if I ever
develop COVID-19. My parents are at advanced age. My wife is a healthcare worker
who see's patients in person. I have been in quarantine since March, removing as
much risk of contracting the virus, and human contact, as feasible.

As the chart shows, my disease has been progressing through the chemo
for more than a year. I have far exceeded the average response time for second
line chemotherapy in lung cancer. The toxicity to the non-cancer parts of my
body has been accumulating. The chemotherapy cycles have been getting harder
over time.

Still, the past 18 months have been the most meaningful 18 months in my life.
Mia was born on Sept. 19, 2019. Chemo has allowed me to be present for her
birth, and the first 15 months of her life. I've been able to watch her first
crawl, her first steps, her first words (she loves saying "dada"!), and she's
not done yet. Yes, it would have been better without the cancer and pandemic.
But that doesn't change the happiness I feel from spending this time with her.
If you gave me the option to relive any of the past 18 month periods of my life,
I would pick 6/2019 - 12/2020.

This current treatment protocol has been slowing the disease down, but is not
stopping or reversing disease progression. Unfortunately, the available
treatment options do not look very promising... I will write more on that later.

1: For those wondering, carbopatin, Taxol, Avastin, Tagrisso.
Now I am maintenance therapy with just Taxol and Tagrisso.
